Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


logic : use dutch man flag algorithm to fiil red in front and blue at the end which will automatically adjust white


class Solution {
public:
    void Swap(int &a,int &b){
        int tmp = a;
        a = b;
        b = tmp;
    }
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
      int r =0;
        int w = 0;
        int b = nums.size()-1;
        while(w<=b){
            if(nums[w]==0){Swap(nums[w],nums[r]);w++;r++;}
            else if(nums[w]==1)w++;
            else {Swap(nums[b],nums[w]);b--;}
        }
        
    }
};
