You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Note that in your output A should precede B.

Example:

Input:[3 1 2 5 3] 

Output:[3, 4] 

A = 3, B = 4


logic : u can use maths to calculte it plus bit manipulation

maths : calculate total sum and sq of total sum then from eq for miss and rep number

vector<int> Solution::repeatedNumber(const vector<int> &A) {
   long long int len = A.size();

    long long int S = (len * (len+1) ) /2;
    long long int P = (len * (len +1) *(2*len +1) )/6;
    long long int missingNumber=0, repeating=0;
     
    for(int i=0;i<A.size(); i++){
       S -= (long long int)A[i];
       P -= (long long int)A[i]*(long long int)A[i];
    }
     
    missingNumber = (S + P/S)/2;

    repeating = missingNumber - S;

    vector <int> ans;

    ans.push_back(repeating);
    ans.push_back(missingNumber);

    return ans;

}
